# Pathfinder-A-search-algorithm-
Pathfinder program used A* search algorithm.

I written the pathfinder program using A* search algorithm. 
I'll work on this program more by using another algoithms. 
You can compile and try my program. Here is the tour: 
1. Use mouse 1, tap once orange cube will appear. It's starting point.
2. Use mouse 1, tap one more again turquose cube will appear. It's ending point.
3. Use mouse 1, tap and draw black cubes. It's the walls which the way can't interfere in there. 
4. After you give both starting and ending point with the walls. Tap SPACE button to start the program.
